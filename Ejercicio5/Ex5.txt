#einverted finds inverted repeats (stem loops) in nucleotide sequences. It identifies regions of local alignment of the input sequence and its reverse complement that exceed a threshold score. The alignments may include a proportion of mismatches and gaps, which correspond to bulges in the stem loop. One or more sequences are read and a file with the sequence(s) (without gap characters) of the inverted repeat regions is written. It can find multiple inverted repeats in a sequence. Only non-overlapping matches are reported.
